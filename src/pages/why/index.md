This blog is my first\* attempt at trying to develop my writing style and also help myself get thoughts down. I've always loved the "design" of blogs, how to say enough to capture someone's attention but not so long to lose someone's attention. I think it's important to highlight other's work and keep track of all cool things I see.

I'm also using this blog to help gain more insight into how Gatsby works and if its a good fit for other static site I develop in the future. I love to try out new technology, but also tend to abandon it after I reach the first milestone. Hopefully this blog will help me capture the essence of what I'm trying to learn and cement that in time.

_\* I've wiped my memory of previous attempts._
